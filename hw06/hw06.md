Provide full program code of fibo(n) function which returns array with elements of Fibonacci sequence

n - length of Fibonacci sequence.

NOTE: The Fibonacci sequence it's a sequence where some element it's a sum of two previous elements --> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...

EXAMPLE OF Inputs/Ouputs when using this function: 
```
>>> print fibo(6)
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```
#
Provide full program code of fibo_element(n) function which returns element of Fibonacci sequence which index has a value equal n.

n - index of element of Fibonacci sequence.

NOTE: The Fibonacci sequence it's a sequence where some element it's a sum of two previous elements --> 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,....

EXAMPLE OF Inputs/Ouputs when using this function: 
```
>>> print fibo_element(6)
8
```
#
Provide full program code of parse_number(num) function which returns the dict with following structure: {odd: number of odd digits in input value, even: number of even digits of input value} or false when wrong input value.

num - input number.

NOTE: Assume that the "zero" digit also belongs to even numbers

EXAMPLE OF Inputs/Ouputs when using this function:
```
>>>print parse_number(34567)
{'odd': 3, 'even': 2}

>>>print parse_number(100)
{'odd': 1, 'even': 2}

>>>print parse_number("word")
False
```
#
Provide full program code of count_symbols(word) function which returns the dict with following structure: `{<symbol_1>: <number_in_word>, <symbol_2>: <number_in_word>,.....}` or false when wrong input value.

word - type str.

EXAMPLE OF Inputs/Ouputs when using this function:
```
>>> print count_symbols("abracadabra")
{'a': 5, 'r': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 1}

>>> print count_symbols("100500")
{'1': 1, '0': 4, '5': 1}

>>> print count_symbols("##$$aa")
{'a': 2, '#': 2, '$': 2}

>>> print count_symbols(125)
False
```
